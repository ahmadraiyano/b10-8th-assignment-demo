## React Fundamentals Used
This project makes use of the following React fundamental concepts:

- **JSX**: Used for rendering UI components.
- **Components**: Functional components were created for different sections of the website.
- **Props**: Passed data between components for dynamic rendering.
- **State**: Local component state was managed using `useState` hooks.
- **Event Handling**: Used event listeners to handle user interactions such as clicks, form submissions, etc.
- **Effect Hook**: Used `useEffect` for handling side effects like fetching data and updating the DOM.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Rendered different views based on conditions like login status or form validation.
- **Lists and Keys**: Rendered lists of data dynamically using `.map()` and keys for efficient rendering.
  
## Data Management
For handling and managing data in this project, the following techniques were used:

- **Local Storage**: Data persistence across page reloads is handled using the browser's localStorage API, storing important information such as user preferences, form data, etc.

## Features of the Website/Project

Here are key features of the project:
   
2. **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Based on user preferences, content is dynamically rendered using React state and Context API, providing a customized user experience.
   
4. **Data Persistence**: Information such as user preferences and form inputs are stored in local storage, so they persist across sessions.

## Technologies Used
- **React** (for front-end UI)
- **React Router** (for navigation)
- **CSS** (for styling)
- **Local Storage API** (for data persistence)
- **Context API** (for state management)
- **Netlify** (for deployment)
